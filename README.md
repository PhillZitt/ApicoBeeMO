# BeeMO #

This mod creates three cheap machines that modify the genetic traits ( on both alleles ) as follows:

**Maximizer**: Sets all of a bee's numeric traits to 6.
**Minimizer**: Sets all of a bee's numeric traits to 2.
**Enabler**: Sets a bee to Cathermal, Any Climate, Rain-loving, Snow-loving, and not Grumpy.

I don't recommend using this mod until you have at least half of Tier 2 Bees, but ~~I'm a Mod Dev not a cop~~ you do you.
